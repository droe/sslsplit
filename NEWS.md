-   Add -a and -b for initial basic client certificate support (pull req #194
    by @naf419, issue #46).
-   Respect `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` for reproducible builds (pull req #192 by

    of used CA certificate differ (issue #189).
-   Fix keyUsage to match the type of leaf key used instead of copying from
    upstream certificate (issue #195).

-   Fix build on FreeBSD 12 (patch-proc.c r436571 from FreeBSD ports).
-   Minor bugfixes and improvements.


### SSLsplit 0.5.2 2018-02-10

-   Add support for SSLv2 ClientHello handshake format for SSLv3/TLS
    connections and while there, essentially fixing autossl for clients using
    SSLv2 ClientHello handshake format with SSLv3/TLS (#185).
-   Suppress Upgrade header in order to prevent upgrading connections to
    WebSockets or HTTP/2 (#91).
-   Add -M for writing an SSLKEYLOGFILE compatible log file (issue #184).
-   Fix error handling for Darwin libproc functions (-i).
-   Fix session cache misses and failed unit tests on MIPS by fixing undefined
    behaviour in session cache hash functions (Debian #848919 and #851271).
-   Synthesize MAC addresses to avoid the requirement for root privileges and
    waiting for ARP timeouts on some platforms in log2pcap.py (issue #169).
-   Minor bugfixes and improvements.


### SSLsplit 0.5.1 2018-01-14

-   Dump master key in NSS key log format in debug mode, allowing decryption of
    SSL connections using Wireshark (issue #121).
-   Add support for DSA and ECDSA certificates using hash algorithms other than
    SHA-1.
-   Copy basicConstraints, keyUsage and extendedKeyUsage X509v3 extensions from
    the original certificate and only generate them anew if they were not
    present (issue #73).
-   Add -q to set the CRL distribution point on all forged certificates
    (pull req #159 by @antalos).
-   Add IPv6 support to netfilter NAT engine (pull req #179 by @armakar).
-   Extend -L content logging with EOF message to allow log parsers to figure
    out when a connection ends (issue #128 by @mattes).  Note that log parsers
    need to be adjusted to handle the new EOF message.
-   Fix potential segfaults in src.bev/dst.bev (pull req #174 by @sonertari).
-   Fix SSL connections that result from autossl to shutdown cleanly.
-   Fix data processing when EOF is received before all incoming data has been
    processed.
-   Fix multiple signal handling issues in the privilege separation parent
    which led to the parent process being killed ungracefully (SIGTERM) or
    being stuck in wait() while still having signals (SIGQUIT etc) queued up
    for forwarding to the child process (issue #137).
-   No longer assume an out of memory condition when a certificate contains
    neither a CN nor a subjectAltName extension.
-   Fix parallel make build (-j) for the test target (issue #140).

    user (pull req #141 by @cgroschupp).

    to 10.12.6 and High Sierra 10.13; fix headers for Mac OS X 10.6 to 10.6.8.
-   Minor bugfixes and improvements.


### SSLsplit 0.5.0 2016-03-27

-   Generically support STARTTLS through the new autossl proxyspec type that
    upgrades a TCP connection to SSL/TLS when a ClientHello message is seen
    (based on contribution by @RichardPoole42, pull req #87).
-   Add separate src/dst host and port format specifiers %S, %p, %D and %q
    to -F (pull req #74 by @AdamJacobMuller).
-   Add options -w and -W to write generated leaf key, original and forged
    certificates to disk (issue #67 by @psychomario).
-   Add signal SIGUSR1 to re-open long-living -l/-L log files (issue #52).
-   Add contributed -L log parsing scripts to extra/, including conversion to
    PCAP using emulated IP and TCP headers (contributed by @mak, issue #27).
-   Enable full-strength DHE and ECDHE by default, even for non-RSA leaf keys,
    in order to avoid weak cipher warnings from browsers (issue #119).
-   Use the same hash algorithm in signatures on forged certificates as the
    original certificates use, instead of always using SHA-1.
-   Removed all references to SHA-1 and small key RSA root CA keys from
    documentation, examples and unit testing (issue #83).
-   Introduce privilege separation architecture with privileged parent process
    and unprivileged child process; all files are now opened with the
    privileges of the user running SSLsplit; arguments to -S/-F are no longer
    relative to the chroot() if used with the -j option.
-   Filenames generated by -S and -F %d and %s changed from [host]:port to
    host,port format and using underscore instead of colon in IPv6 addresses
    in order to be NTFS clean (issue #69).
-   Connect log format: host and port are now separate fields (issues #69 #74).
-   Only initialize DNS subsystems when DNS lookups are actually needed by the
    loaded proxy specifications (related to issue #104).
-   Removed the non-standard word "unmodified" from the 2-clause BSD license.
-   Warn when an OpenSSL version mismatch is detected (issue #88).
-   Add XNU headers for OS X 10.11 El Capitan (issue #116).

-   Fix build with OpenSSL versions that had SSLv3 support removed.
-   Fix a rare segmentation fault upon receiving EOF on the outbound connection
    while it has not been established yet (patch by @eunsoopark, issue #124).
-   Fix SSL sessions to actually time out (patch by @eunsoopark, issue #115).

    system when also using -i (pull reqs #36, #53, #54, #55 by @landonf).
-   Add option -i to look up local process owning a connection for logging to
    connection log; initial support on Mac OS X (by @landonf) and FreeBSD.
-   Add option -r to force a specific SSL/TLS protocol version (issue #30).
-   Add option -R to disable specific SSL/TLS protocol versions (issue #30).

    ioctl(/dev/pf) to root even on an fd initially opened by root (issue #65).

    also to OpenSSL 0.9.8y; fixes cert loading crash due to bug in in OpenSSL.

-   Also build ipfw NAT engine if pf is detected to support pf divert-to.
