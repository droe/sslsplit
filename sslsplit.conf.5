\fBsslsplit.conf\fR \- Configuration file for SSLsplit
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
The file sslsplit.conf configures SSLsplit, sslsplit(1).
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
The file consists of comments and options with arguments. Each line which starts with a hash (\fB#\fR) symbol is ignored by the parser. Options and arguments are of the form \fBOption Argument\fR. The arguments are of the following types:
.TP
\fBBOOL\fR 
Boolean value (yes/no).
.TP 
\fBSTRING\fR
String.
.SH "DIRECTIVES"
.LP 
When an option is not used (hashed or doesn't exist in the configuration file) sslsplit takes a default action.
.TP 
\fBCACert STRING\fR
Use CA cert (and key) to sign forged certs.
.TP
\fBCAKey STRING\fR
Use CA key (and cert) to sign forged certs.
.TP 
\fBClientCert STRING\fR
Use cert from pemfile when destination requests client certs.
.TP
\fBClientKey STRING\fR
Use key from pemfile when destination requests client certs.
.TP
\fBCAChain STRING\fR
Use CA chain from pemfile (intermediate and root CA certs).
.TP
\fBLeafCerts STRING\fR
Use key from pemfile for leaf certs.
.br
Default: generate
.TP
\fBCRL STRING\fR
Use URL as CRL distribution point for all forged certs.
.TP
\fBTargetCertDir STRING\fR
Use cert+chain+key PEM files from certdir to target all sites matching the common names (non-matching: generate if CA).
.TP
\fBWriteGenCertsDir STRING\fR
Write leaf key and only generated certificates to gendir.
.TP
\fBWriteAllCertsDir STRING\fR
Write leaf key and all certificates to gendir.
.TP
\fBDenyOCSP BOOL\fR
Deny all OCSP requests on all proxyspecs.
.TP
\fBPassthrough BOOL\fR
Passthrough SSL connections if they cannot be split because of client cert auth or no matching cert and no CA.
.br 
Default: drop
.TP
\fBDHGroupParams STRING\fR
Use DH group params from pemfile.
.br 
Default: keyfiles or auto
.TP
\fBECDHCurve STRING\fR
Use ECDH named curve.
.br 
Default: prime256v1
.TP
\fBSSLCompression BOOL\fR
Enable/disable SSL/TLS compression on all connections.
.TP
\fBForceSSLProto STRING\fR
Force SSL/TLS protocol version only.
.br 
Default: all
.TP
\fBDisableSSLProto STRING\fR
Disable SSL/TLS protocol version.
.br 
Default: none
.TP
\fBCiphers STRING\fR
Use the given OpenSSL cipher suite spec.
.br 
Default: ALL:-aNULL
.TP 
\fBOpenSSLEngine STRING\fR
The OpenSSL engine to activate, either the ID or the full path to the shared
library implementing the engine.  If an ID is given, the engine needs to be
known to the system-wide OpenSSL configuration.  Only available if built
against a version of OpenSSL with engine support.
.TP 
\fBNATEngine STRING\fR
Specify default NAT engine to use.
.TP 
\fBUser STRING\fR
Drop privileges to user.
.br 
Default: nobody, if run as root
.TP
\fBGroup STRING\fR
Drop privileges to group.
.br
Default: Primary group of user
.TP 
\fBChroot STRING\fR
chroot() to jaildir (impacts sni proxyspecs, see sslsplit(1)).
.TP 
\fBPidFile STRING\fR
Write pid to file.
.TP 
\fBConnectLog STRING\fR
Connect log: log one line summary per connection to logfile.
.TP 
\fBContentLog STRING\fR
Content log: full data to file or named pipe (excludes ContentLogDir/ContentLogPathSpec).
.TP 
\fBContentLogDir STRING\fR
Content log: full data to separate files in dir (excludes ContentLog/ContentLogPathSpec).
.TP 
\fBContentLogPathSpec STRING\fR
Content log: full data to sep files with %% subst (excludes ContentLog/ContentLogDir).
.TP 
\fBLogProcInfo BOOL\fR
Look up local process owning each connection for logging.
.TP 
\fBMasterKeyLog STRING\fR
Log master keys to logfile in SSLKEYLOGFILE format.
.TP 
\fBDaemon BOOL\fR
Daemon mode: run in background, log error messages to syslog.
.TP 
\fBDebug BOOL\fR
Debug mode: run in foreground, log debug messages on stderr.
.TP
\fBVerifyPeer BOOL\fR
Verify peer using default certificates.
.br
Default: no
.TP
\fBAddSNIToCertificate BOOL\fR
When disabled, never add the SNI to forged certificates, even if the SNI provided by the client does not match the server certificate's CN/SAN. Helps pass the wrong.host test at https://badssl.com.
.br
Default: yes
.TP 
\fBProxySpec STRING\fR
Proxy specification: type listenaddr+port [natengine|targetaddr+port|"sni"+port]. Multiple specs are allowed, one on each line.
